## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I experimented with CSS Grid to build a staggered, cascading layout. Specifically, I utilized 'grid-row' and 'align-self' to break the standard grid flow and create more dynamic visual hierarchies. It was a great exercise in understanding how to position elements precisely within a grid container.

```css
.supervisor {
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
  align-self: center;
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to dive deeper into complex grid structures and focus on mastering advanced responsive design techniques.
